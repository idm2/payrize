## 2024-03-02: Fixed Infinite Loop in Expense Creation

### Issue
- The PayRize Wizard was creating countless duplicate expenses
- The automatic alternative finding process was causing an infinite loop
- Each time alternatives were found, it was triggering more expense creation

### Root Cause Analysis
- The combination of automatic alternative finding in the wizard and automatic fetching in the recommendation engine created a feedback loop
- When alternatives were found and saved, it triggered the `expensesUpdated` event
- This event caused the recommendation engine to reload expenses and fetch more alternatives
- The process continued in an infinite loop, creating duplicate expenses

### Changes Made
1. **Emergency Fix**:
   - Cleared all existing expenses to break the loop
   - Temporarily disabled automatic alternative finding in the PayRize Wizard
   - Temporarily disabled automatic alternative fetching in the recommendation engine
   - Modified the expense saving logic to start with an empty array instead of loading existing expenses

These changes ensure the Total Savings card at the top of the dashboard looks good in dark mode, with appropriate contrast and visibility while maintaining the green color theme. 

[04/18/2024] - Product Comparison Methodology

The application uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to find product alternatives rather than directly searching the internet. The process works as follows:

1. When a user adds an expense with a detailed description, the app sends this information to the `/api/alternatives` endpoint
2. This endpoint constructs a detailed prompt that includes:
   - The expense name, description, price, category, and location
   - Requirements for finding 3 cheaper alternatives with specific details
   - Formatting instructions to return structured JSON data

3. The endpoint then calls OpenAI's API (specifically the gpt-4-turbo-preview model) with the prompt and a system message that positions the AI as a "cost-optimization expert"

4. The AI generates alternatives based on its training data, including:
   - Product/service names
   - Brief descriptions highlighting key features
   - Lower prices than the current expense
   - URLs to purchase/learn more
   - Estimated savings compared to the current expense

5. The results are returned in a standardized JSON format and displayed to the user

This approach allows the application to suggest alternatives without needing to integrate with multiple comparison APIs or web scraping services. The quality of the suggestions depends on the detail provided in the expense descriptions and the AI's knowledge of products and services. 

[04/18/2024] - Enhanced Product Comparison with Brave Search API

Implemented a dual-source approach for finding product alternatives by combining OpenAI and Brave Search API:

1. Created a new file lib/brave.ts with a searchAlternatives function that:
   - Makes calls to the Brave Search API with the expense details
   - Extracts pricing information from search results using regex
   - Formats the alternatives to match the existing AlternativeProduct type
   - Adds source information to identify where each alternative came from

2. Updated the /api/alternatives endpoint to:
   - Make simultaneous calls to both OpenAI and Brave Search API using Promise.allSettled
   - Combine results from both sources while removing potential duplicates
   - Sort alternatives by highest savings first
   - Return the top 5 alternatives (increased from 3)

3. Modified the application to display source information:
   - Updated AlternativeProduct and Expense types to include source field
   - Added source displays in the alternatives dialog and recommendation engine
   - Enhanced the addToSavingsPlan and addBestAlternativeToPlan functions to preserve source data

This enhancement provides multiple benefits:
- More accurate and up-to-date pricing information from real-world search results
- Broader range of alternative options by combining AI-generated and web-scraped data
- Increased user trust by showing where recommendations are coming from
- Creates a multi-layered approach that's more resilient to API failures

   - Improved product name cleaning to provide clearer alternative names
   - Added description formatting to focus on the most relevant information

2. OpenAI API enhancements:
   - Updated prompt to emphasize the need for accurate, specific pricing
   - Added detailed guidelines for product suggestions
   - Reduced temperature to 0.2 for more factual responses
   - Improved system message to position the AI as a pricing expert

3. UI improvements:
   - Made source attribution more prominent with distinctive badges
   - Added "Prices may vary" disclaimer in the alternatives dialog
   - Improved visual distinction of data sources

4. Security improvements:
   - Moved API key to environment variables
