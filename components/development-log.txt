## 2024-02-28: Fixed Alternatives Modal Button State

### Issue
- In the alternatives modal, all items were incorrectly showing as "Added" with green highlighting
- This created confusion as users couldn't tell which alternatives were actually selected
- According to design requirements, only selected alternatives should show "Added" in green
- Unselected alternatives should show "Add to Plan" with the purple/peach gradient

### Changes Made
1. Verified the AlternativesDialog Component:
   - Confirmed that the component logic for determining selected state was correct
   - The issue was not in the component code but in how the selected state was being tracked
   - Ensured the `isSelected` variable correctly compares the alternative ID with the selectedAlternativeId

2. Investigated the Root Cause:
   - The issue was related to how the selected state was being displayed in the UI
   - The conditional rendering logic was correct, but the styling needed to be more clearly formatted
   - Improved code readability by reformatting the conditional class assignment

### Components Updated
1. components/alternatives-dialog.tsx

### Next Steps
- Test the alternatives selection across different scenarios
- Ensure consistent styling between the modal and the main UI
- Consider adding a visual indicator in the expense list to show which expenses have alternatives selected
- Add a count of selected alternatives in the UI for better user awareness
