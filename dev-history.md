# Development History

## UI Enhancements and Analytics Improvements (2024-02-27)

### Chat Discussions
- User requested several UI enhancements:
  - Adding category filtering tabs on the expenses page
  - Fixing the pie chart on the dashboard that was being cut off at the top
  - Adding more accent colors for better visual distinction
  - Ensuring the analytics page uses real data instead of sample data
  - Modifying the analytics expenses page for color-coded pie chart slices
  - Changing the analytics savings section to display bars in varying colors based on their values

### Files Modified

#### 1. components/expense-tracker.tsx
- Added category filtering functionality with tabs
- Implemented dynamic tab generation based on user's expense categories
- Updated expense totals to reflect filtered expenses
- Added state management for active category
- Modified the UI to include responsive tab layout

```tsx
// Key code additions:
const [activeCategory, setActiveCategory] = useState<string>("all")

// Get unique categories from expenses
const categories = useMemo(() => {
  const uniqueCategories = Array.from(new Set(expenses.map(expense => expense.category)))
  return ["all", ...uniqueCategories].filter(Boolean)
}, [expenses])

// Filter expenses by active category
const filteredExpenses = useMemo(() => {
  if (activeCategory === "all") return expenses
  return expenses.filter(expense => expense.category === activeCategory)
}, [expenses, activeCategory])

// Added tabs UI:
{categories.length > 1 && (
  <Tabs defaultValue="all" value={activeCategory} onValueChange={setActiveCategory} className="mb-6">
    <TabsList className="w-full flex overflow-x-auto">
      {categories.map(category => (
        <TabsTrigger 
          key={category} 
          value={category}
          className="flex-1 capitalize"
        >
          {category === "all" ? "All Categories" : category}
        </TabsTrigger>
      ))}
    </TabsList>
  </Tabs>
)}
```

#### 2. components/expense-categories-chart.tsx
- Fixed pie chart display issues by adding proper margins
- Reduced outer radius to ensure chart fits within container
- Added TypeScript type definitions for chart components
- Improved label positioning and readability

```tsx
// Added type definition for label props:
interface LabelProps {
  cx: number
  cy: number
  midAngle: number
  innerRadius: number
  outerRadius: number
  percent: number
  index: number
}

// Updated PieChart with margins and smaller radius:
<PieChart margin={{ top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20 }}>
  <Pie
    data={data}
    cx="50%"
    cy="50%"
    labelLine={false}
    label={renderCustomizedLabel}
    outerRadius={130}
    fill="#8884d8"
    dataKey="value"
  >
    {/* ... */}
  </Pie>
</PieChart>
```

#### 3. app/analytics/page.tsx
- Updated analytics page to use real expense data from localStorage
- Implemented dynamic category grouping for pie chart
- Generated realistic monthly data based on actual expense totals
- Added empty state for when no expenses are present
- Added more accent colors for better visual distinction
- Implemented color-coded pie chart slices based on expense categories
- Added varying colors for savings bars based on savings amount

```tsx
// Load real data from localStorage:
const [expenses, setExpenses] = useState<Expense[]>([])
  
useEffect(() => {
  const savedExpenses = localStorage.getItem("expenses")
  if (savedExpenses) {
    setExpenses(JSON.parse(savedExpenses))
  }
}, [])

// Group expenses by category for pie chart:
const expenseCategories = useMemo(() => {
  const categories: Record<string, number> = {}
  
  expenses.forEach(expense => {
    if (!expense.category) return
    
    if (categories[expense.category]) {
      categories[expense.category] += expense.amount
    } else {
      categories[expense.category] = expense.amount
    }
  })
  
  return Object.entries(categories).map(([name, value]) => ({ name, value }))
}, [expenses])

// Color-coded savings bars:
const getSavingsBarColor = (value: number, index: number) => {
  const maxSavings = Math.max(...monthlySavings.map(item => item.amount))
  const percentage = (value / maxSavings) * 100
  
  if (percentage > 80) return "#10b981" // Green for high savings
  if (percentage > 50) return "#3b82f6" // Blue for medium savings
  return "#9333ea" // Purple for lower savings
}
```

### Problems Encountered & Solutions

1. **Problem**: Pie chart was being cut off at the top of the container.
   **Solution**: Added proper margins to the PieChart component and reduced the outer radius from 150 to 130 to ensure it fits within the container.

2. **Problem**: TypeScript errors for missing type definitions in the chart components.
   **Solution**: Created a proper `LabelProps` interface to define the types for the chart label function parameters.

3. **Problem**: Analytics page was using sample data instead of real user data.
   **Solution**: Implemented state management to load expenses from localStorage and transform them into the appropriate format for the charts.

4. **Problem**: Needed to generate realistic monthly data without historical records.
   **Solution**: Created a function to generate simulated monthly data based on the user's actual expense totals, with realistic variations to show trends.

5. **Problem**: Needed to implement color-coding for savings bars based on their values.
   **Solution**: Created a `getSavingsBarColor` function that calculates the percentage of each savings amount relative to the maximum and assigns colors accordingly.

### Next Steps
- Consider adding date filtering for expenses
- Implement data export for analytics charts
- Add comparison with previous periods
- Consider adding more chart types (e.g., stacked bar charts)
- Implement proper data persistence for historical analytics 

## Category Color Selection Feature (2024-02-27)

### Chat Discussions
- User requested the ability to select colors for expense categories
- Shared a color palette image with five theme colors: teal, blue, purple, pink, and orange
- Requested that selected colors be displayed on graphs and charts
- Wanted both theme color selection and custom color input via a color picker

### Files Modified

#### 1. components/ui/color-picker.tsx (New Component)
- Created a new color picker component with theme colors and custom color input
- Implemented color preview and selection functionality
- Added hex color validation for custom colors

```tsx
// Theme colors from the palette
export const THEME_COLORS = [
  { name: "Teal", value: "#2DD4BF" },
  { name: "Blue", value: "#38BDF8" },
  { name: "Purple", value: "#6366F1" },
  { name: "Pink", value: "#EC4899" },
  { name: "Orange", value: "#FB923C" },
]

// Color picker component with theme colors and custom input
export function ColorPicker({ value, onChange, className }: ColorPickerProps) {
  const [customColor, setCustomColor] = React.useState(value || "")
  
  // Custom color input with validation
  const handleCustomColorChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const newColor = e.target.value
    setCustomColor(newColor)
    
    // Only update if it's a valid hex color
    if (/^#([0-9A-F]{3}){1,2}$/i.test(newColor)) {
      onChange(newColor)
    }
  }
  
  // Color selection UI
  return (
    <Popover>
      <PopoverTrigger asChild>
        <Button 
          variant="outline" 
          className={cn("w-full justify-between", className)}
          style={{ backgroundColor: value ? `${value}20` : undefined }}
        >
          {/* Color preview and name display */}
        </Button>
      </PopoverTrigger>
      <PopoverContent>
        <div className="grid grid-cols-5 gap-2">
          {/* Theme color buttons */}
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-1">
          {/* Custom color input */}
        </div>
      </PopoverContent>
    </Popover>
  )
}
```

#### 2. lib/utils.ts
- Added color property to the Expense type
- Implemented functions for storing and retrieving category colors

```tsx
// Updated Expense type with color property
export type Expense = {
  // ... existing properties
  color?: string // Category color
}

// Store category colors in localStorage
export function getCategoryColors(): Record<string, string> {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return {}
  
  const stored = localStorage.getItem('categoryColors')
  return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : {}
}

// Save category colors to localStorage
export function saveCategoryColor(category: string, color: string): void {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return
  
  const colors = getCategoryColors()
  colors[category] = color
  localStorage.setItem('categoryColors', JSON.stringify(colors))
}

// Get color for a specific category
export function getCategoryColor(category: string): string | undefined {
  return getCategoryColors()[category]
}
```

#### 3. components/category-combobox.tsx
- Updated to include color selection when adding new categories
- Modified to display colors for existing categories
- Ensured color persistence in localStorage

```tsx
// Added color selection to category combobox
const [selectedColor, setSelectedColor] = useState(THEME_COLORS[0].value)

// Save category with color
const handleCreateCategory = (value: string) => {
  const newCategory = value.trim()
  if (newCategory) {
    setCategories(prev => [...prev, newCategory])
    setValue(newCategory)
    saveCategoryColor(newCategory, selectedColor)
    setOpen(false)
  }
}

// Display color indicators for existing categories
{categories.map((category) => (
  <CommandItem
    key={category}
    value={category}
    onSelect={() => {
      setValue(category)
      setOpen(false)
    }}
  >
    <div 
      className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 rounded-full" 
      style={{ backgroundColor: getCategoryColors()[category] || "#9333EA" }}
    />
    {category}
  </CommandItem>
))}
```

#### 4. components/expense-categories-chart.tsx
- Updated to utilize category colors from localStorage
- Modified to use a fallback color when no category color is defined
- Adjusted to prevent chart cutoff

```tsx
// Load category colors from localStorage
const [categoryColors, setCategoryColors] = useState<Record<string, string>>({})

useEffect(() => {
  setCategoryColors(getCategoryColors())
}, [])

// Get color for a category
const getCategoryColor = (category: string) => {
  return categoryColors[category] || DISTINCT_COLORS[index % DISTINCT_COLORS.length]
}

// Use category colors in the pie chart
<Pie
  data={data}
  cx="50%"
  cy="50%"
  labelLine={false}
  label={renderCustomizedLabel}
  outerRadius={130}
  fill="#8884d8"
  dataKey="value"
>
  {data.map((entry, index) => (
    <Cell 
      key={`cell-${index}`} 
      fill={getCategoryColor(entry.name)} 
    />
  ))}
</Pie>
```

### Problems Encountered & Solutions

1. **Problem**: TypeScript errors when implementing the color picker component.
   **Solution**: Created proper interfaces for component props and implemented type checking for color values.

2. **Problem**: Pie chart was being cut off even after adding margins.
   **Solution**: Further reduced the outer radius and added padding to the container to ensure proper display.

3. **Problem**: Needed a consistent way to store and retrieve category colors.
   **Solution**: Implemented centralized functions in utils.ts for managing category colors in localStorage.

4. **Problem**: Ensuring color consistency across different components.
   **Solution**: Created a flexible ColorPicker component that could be reused across the application and implemented helper functions to retrieve colors consistently.

### Next Steps
- Add ability to edit colors for existing categories
- Implement color themes for dark/light mode
- Add color accessibility checks
- Add animation when changing category colors

    if (savedExpenses) {
      const expenses = JSON.parse(savedExpenses) as Expense[]
      const uniqueCategories = Array.from(new Set(expenses.map((expense: Expense) => expense.category)))
      setCategories(uniqueCategories.filter(Boolean).sort() as string[])
    }

    // Get category colors
    const colors = getCategoryColors()
    setCategoryColors(colors)
  }, [])

  // Add, edit, and delete category functions
  const handleAddCategory = () => {
    // Validation and category addition logic
  }

  const handleEditCategory = () => {
    // Validation and category update logic
  }

3. **Problem**: Negative margin in SavingsChart was causing alignment issues.
   **Solution**: Removed the negative margin and used proper flex centering instead.

4. **Problem**: Some charts were marked for removal in the UI.
   **Solution**: Identified and removed unnecessary duplicate charts.

### Next Steps
- Test charts at different screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior
- Consider adding legends below charts for better category identification
- Explore adding click interactions to pie slices for filtering
- Consider adding animations to chart transitions

## Analytics Page Pie Chart Alignment Fix (2024-02-28)

### Chat Discussions
- User reported that the pie chart on the ANALYTICS > EXPENSE page was cut off at the top
- The legend text was running into the pie chart
- The chart needed to be properly centered vertically and horizontally

### Files Modified

  * Increased paddingTop from 10px to 25px to move legend text further down

```tsx
// Key changes:
<PieChart margin={{ top: 30, right: 20, bottom: 40, left: 20 }}>
  <Pie
    data={data}
    cx="50%"
    cy="50%"
    labelLine={false}
    label={renderCustomizedLabel}
    outerRadius={120}
    // ...

    height={36}
    wrapperStyle={{ paddingTop: "25px" }}
  />
</PieChart>
```

#### 2. app/analytics/page.tsx
- Changed the chart container's vertical alignment from `items-start` to `items-center` for proper centering

```tsx
// Changed from:
<div className="h-[300px] flex items-start justify-center">

// To:
<div className="h-[300px] flex items-center justify-center">
```

### Problems Encountered & Solutions

1. **Problem**: The pie chart was positioned too high in the container, causing it to be cut off at the top.
   **Solution**: Adjusted the vertical position (cy) to 50% and increased top margin to 30px to center the chart properly.

2. **Problem**: The legend text was too close to the pie chart, causing visual clutter.
   **Solution**: Increased the paddingTop in the legend's wrapperStyle from 10px to 25px to create more space between the chart and legend.

3. **Problem**: The chart container's alignment wasn't properly centering the chart.
   **Solution**: Changed the flex alignment from items-start to items-center for proper vertical centering.

### Next Steps
- Test the alignment at different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness
- Consider adding responsive adjustments for smaller screens
- Ensure consistent alignment across all chart components

## 2024-03-01: PayRize Wizard Implementation

### Chat Discussions
- User requested the development of a user-friendly setup wizard called "PayRize Wizard"
- The wizard should guide users through initial setup steps including:
  - Inputting their name
  - Adding income sources
  - Adding personal and business expenses
  - Setting a savings goal
- Emphasis was placed on creating an engaging experience, particularly during the final "PayRize" step

## 2024-03-02: Automatic Alternative Selection Feature

### Chat Discussions
- User requested the app to automatically find alternatives and add them to the REDUCE column
- The app should automatically select the best alternative (highest savings) for each expense
- This streamlines the user experience by removing manual selection steps

### Files Modified
- `components/recommendation-engine.tsx`

### Code Explanation
1. Added a new function `addBestAlternativeToPlan`:
   - Takes an expense and its alternatives as parameters
   - Identifies the best alternative based on highest savings
   - Updates the expense with the selected alternative
   - Saves the updated expenses to localStorage
   - Dispatches an event to notify other components

2. Modified the `fetchAlternatives` function:
   - After fetching alternatives, it automatically selects the best one
   - Added a small delay to ensure alternatives are saved before selection
   - Only selects alternatives that provide positive savings

3. Fixed TypeScript type issues:
   - Added proper type annotations for parameters in map and reduce functions
   - Ensured type safety throughout the implementation

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
- **Problem**: Potential race condition between saving alternatives and selecting them
  **Solution**: Added a small timeout delay to ensure alternatives are saved first

- **Problem**: TypeScript linter errors for implicit 'any' types
  **Solution**: Added explicit type annotations for all parameters

## 2024-03-02: Fixed PayRize Wizard Duplicate Key Issue

### Chat Discussions
- User reported that clicking "Get Your PayRize" button in the final step of the wizard wasn't working
- Console error showed: "Encountered two children with the same key" warning
- The issue was related to duplicate React keys when rendering components

### Files Modified
1. **components/payrize-wizard.tsx**
   - Improved ID generation logic for expenses
   - Added a Set to track existing IDs and prevent duplicates
   - Enhanced the ID assignment process for both personal and business expenses
   - Ensured uniqueness across existing and new expenses

### Code Explanation
- The previous implementation used `expense.id || crypto.randomUUID()` which could result in duplicate IDs
- The new implementation:
  1. Creates a Set of all existing expense IDs from localStorage
  2. For each new expense, checks if its ID already exists
  3. If the ID exists or is missing, generates a new UUID
  4. Adds each generated ID to the tracking Set to prevent duplicates within the same batch
  5. Returns expenses with guaranteed unique IDs

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
- **Duplicate Keys**: Fixed by implementing a more robust ID generation system
- **React Rendering Issues**: Resolved by ensuring all expense objects have unique IDs
- **Data Integrity**: Improved by preventing ID collisions between existing and new expenses

### Next Steps
- Add more robust error handling for localStorage operations
- Consider implementing a database-backed ID system for larger applications
- Add logging to track ID generation in development environments

## 2024-03-02: Fixed Infinite Loop in Expense Creation

### Chat Discussions
- User reported that the PayRize Wizard had entered into a loop and was creating countless expenses
- The issue was causing performance problems and making the application unusable
- An emergency fix was needed to stop the loop and delete all existing expenses

### Files Modified
1. **components/payrize-wizard.tsx**
   - Disabled automatic alternative finding functionality
   - Modified expense saving logic to start with an empty array
   - Updated success message to inform users that expenses were cleared
   - Added safeguards to prevent duplicate expense creation

2. **components/recommendation-engine.tsx**
   - Disabled automatic alternative fetching in the useEffect hook
   - Prevented the feedback loop between expense creation and alternative finding

### Code Explanation
- The issue was caused by a feedback loop between two components:
  1. The PayRize Wizard would save expenses and find alternatives
  2. This would trigger the `expensesUpdated` event
  3. The recommendation engine would reload expenses and fetch more alternatives
  4. This would trigger more events, creating an infinite loop

- The fix:
  1. Cleared all existing expenses to break the loop
  2. Disabled automatic processes that were causing the feedback
  3. Implemented a more controlled approach to expense creation

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
- **Infinite Loop**: Fixed by breaking the feedback cycle between components
- **Duplicate Expenses**: Resolved by clearing all expenses and starting fresh
- **Event Handling**: Improved by temporarily disabling automatic processes

### Next Steps
- Implement a more robust event handling system with proper safeguards
- Add debounce mechanisms to prevent rapid successive events
- Create a monitoring system to detect and prevent excessive operations
- Re-enable automatic features with proper controls in place

## 2024-03-02: Added Bulk Expense Clearing Feature

2. **components/dashboard-header.tsx**
   - Added the ClearExpensesButton to the header actions
   - Updated the component interface to include the onAddExpense prop
   - Fixed the import handling functionality

3. **components/expense-tracker.tsx**
   - Updated to use the new DashboardHeader with proper props
   - Ensured the add expense functionality works with the header

### Code Explanation
- The ClearExpensesButton component provides a simple way to clear all expenses:
  ```typescript
  const handleClearExpenses = () => {
    localStorage.setItem("expenses", "[]");
    window.dispatchEvent(new Event('expensesUpdated'));
    toast({
      title: "Success",
      description: "All expenses have been cleared from the system."
    });
  }
  ```

- The button is integrated into the dashboard header for easy access:
  ```tsx
  <div className="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2">
    <Button onClick={onAddExpense}>Add Expense</Button>
    <ClearExpensesButton />
    {/* Other buttons */}
  </div>
  ```

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
- **Component Integration**: Fixed by updating the DashboardHeaderProps interface to include the onAddExpense prop

### Chat Discussions
- User requested a more engaging loading screen when clicking "Get Your PayRize"
- Shared an example image of a "ducks in a row" loading screen with an animated line
- Specifically asked for a full-screen overlay with animation using brand colors
- Requested the text "Preparing your PayRize" to be displayed

### Files Modified
- `components/payrize-wizard.tsx`
- `app/globals.css`

### Code Explanation
1. Created a full-screen loading overlay component:
   - Implemented a fixed position div that covers the entire screen
   - Applied the purple-to-pink gradient background to match brand colors
   - Added "Please wait while we prepare your PayRize" text
   - Created a container for the animation elements

2. Implemented the wave animation:
   - Created an SVG path that represents a wave
   - Added CSS animation to make the wave move by changing the path data
   - Positioned a coin icon that moves along the wave
   - Used the existing Coins icon from Lucide React

3. Added CSS animations in globals.css:
   - Created a wave animation that morphs the SVG path
   - Implemented a moveAlongWave animation for the coin icon
   - Set both animations to loop infinitely for continuous motion

4. Integrated the loading overlay:
   - Added a state variable to control the visibility of the overlay
   - Replaced toast notifications with the overlay in both the processWizardData and handleSubmit functions
   - Made sure to hide the overlay when processing is complete or on error

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
- **Problem**: SVG path animations are complex to implement
  **Solution**: Used CSS keyframes to animate the path's d attribute for a smooth wave effect

- **Problem**: Coordinating the coin movement with the wave motion
  **Solution**: Created a separate animation for the coin that follows a similar pattern to the wave

- **Problem**: Ensuring the overlay is properly removed after processing
  **Solution**: Added setShowLoadingOverlay(false) in both the success and error handling code paths

### Next Steps
- Add progress indicators to show different stages of processing
- Implement a confetti animation when the PayRize setup is complete
- Add a summary screen showing the alternatives found and potential savings

## 2024-03-03: CSV Button Styling Updates

### Chat Discussions
- User shared a screenshot showing inconsistent CSV button styling
- Requested charcoal-colored CSV buttons on both Dashboard and Expenses pages
- Asked to remove duplicate CSV buttons in the Expense Tracker column
- Wanted consistent styling across the application

### Files Modified
- `components/dashboard-header.tsx`
- `app/expenses/page.tsx`
- `components/expense-tracker.tsx`

### Code Explanation
1. Updated Dashboard CSV buttons:
   - Changed both Export and Import CSV buttons from gradient to outline variant
   - Maintained the same size and layout of the buttons
   - Kept the PayRize Wizard button with its gradient styling

2. Updated Expenses page CSV buttons:
   - Changed the Import CSV button from gradient to outline variant
   - Ensured both Export and Import buttons use the same outline variant
   - Maintained consistent spacing and sizing

3. Removed duplicate CSV buttons from Expense Tracker:
   - Removed the DashboardHeader component that contained the duplicate CSV buttons
   - Created a custom header with just the title and Add Expense button
   - Maintained the same functionality without the redundant CSV buttons

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
- **Problem**: The DashboardHeader component included CSV buttons that were duplicated on the Expenses page
  **Solution**: Created a custom header for the Expense Tracker without the CSV buttons

- **Problem**: Needed to maintain the Add Expense functionality while removing the DashboardHeader
  **Solution**: Added the Add Expense button directly to the custom header

### Next Steps
- Consider adding tooltips to CSV buttons to explain their functionality
- Review other buttons in the application for consistent styling
- Ensure CSV import/export functionality works correctly with the new button styling

## 2024-03-03: Dark Mode Style Fixes

### Files Modified
- `components/alternatives-dialog.tsx`
- `components/payrize-wizard.tsx`
- `components/savings-summary.tsx`
- `development-log.txt`

### Changes Made

**1. Alternatives Dialog Component**
Fixed the background color of alternative cards in dark mode:
```tsx
className={cn(
  "grid gap-2 p-4 rounded-lg border",
  isSelected 
    ? "bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-950/30 border-green-200 dark:border-green-800" 
    : "bg-white dark:bg-card"
)}
```

**2. PayRize Wizard Component**
- Updated the coin icon in the LoadingOverlay to use dark mode colors:
```tsx
<div className="w-12 h-12 rounded-full bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 flex items-center justify-center text-purple-500 dark:text-purple-400">
  <Coins className="h-8 w-8" />
</div>
```

- Fixed the information boxes in both personal and business expense sections:
```tsx
<div className="p-3 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-950/30 border border-blue-100 dark:border-blue-900 rounded-md mb-4">
  <p className="text-sm text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-400">
    <strong>Why we need expense details:</strong> The more information you provide...
  </p>
</div>
```

**3. Savings Summary Component**
- Updated the Total Savings card to use appropriate dark mode colors:
```tsx
<Card className="bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-950/30 border-green-100 dark:border-green-900/50">
  <CardContent className="p-4 sm:p-6">
    <div className="flex items-center">
      <Coins className="h-8 w-8 text-green-600 dark:text-green-400 mr-3 flex-shrink-0" />
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-green-800 dark:text-green-300">Total Savings</h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">Based on your current savings plan</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    {/* ... */}
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### Problem Solved
These changes ensure a consistent appearance in dark mode throughout the application. Elements that previously had hardcoded light mode colors now properly respect the dark mode theme, providing better contrast and user experience in dark mode environments. The green Total Savings card now has appropriate dark mode styling while maintaining its thematic green colors.

## [04/18/2024] - Fixed Remaining localStorage Reference in Analytics Page

### Issue
Despite our earlier fix implementing safeLocalStorage throughout the app, there was still one direct localStorage call in the analytics page that was causing deployment errors on Vercel.

### Root Cause
The Savings Goal Progress section in app/analytics/page.tsx was using a direct call to localStorage within a useMemo hook, causing server-side rendering to fail.

### Solution
Updated the remaining direct localStorage reference:

```typescript
// Before
const savedGoals = localStorage.getItem("savingsGoals")

// After
const savedGoals = safeLocalStorage.getItem("savingsGoals")
```

This ensures that all localStorage access in the application is now properly guarded against server-side rendering environments, allowing Vercel deployment to complete successfully.
