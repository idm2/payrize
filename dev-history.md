# Development History

## OpenAI + Bing Integration for Improved Product Search

### Overview
Implemented a new approach for finding alternatives that combines OpenAI's intelligence with Bing's search capabilities to ensure truly comparable products are found.

### Files Created/Modified
- **New Files:**
  - `lib/openai.ts`: OpenAI integration to find precise comparable product alternatives
  - `lib/bing.ts`: Bing Search implementation to validate and enhance OpenAI suggestions
  
- **Modified Files:**
  - `app/api/alternatives/route.ts`: Updated to use the new search approach with fallback

### Technical Details

#### New Search Approach
1. **OpenAI as Primary Product Finder:**
   - Uses GPT-3.5 to identify exact matching alternatives based on product specifications
   - Handles complex matching requirements (2L vs 1L milk, 100GB vs 50GB storage, etc.)
   - Returns specific product names and search queries for further validation

2. **Bing as Verification & Detail Provider:**
   - Takes OpenAI's product suggestions and validates their existence
   - Adds accurate pricing information and store details
   - Provides direct URLs to purchase the products

3. **Fallback to Previous Methods:**
   - If OpenAI + Bing return no results, falls back to Serper search
   - Ensures backward compatibility and resilience

4. **Google Places Integration:**
   - Still used for finding physical store locations
   - Enhances results with store names, addresses, and distances

#### Key Improvements
- **Exact Specification Matching**: Products now exactly match the original specifications
- **Store Information in Product Titles**: Store names appear in product titles
- **Better Price Extraction**: More accurate price detection from search results
- **Enhanced Sorting**: Improved balanced scoring for sorting alternatives

#### API Configuration
Added environment variables for new services:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For OpenAI GPT integration
- `BING_SEARCH_API_KEY`: For Bing Search verification

### User Experience Enhancements
- Better product matching (exactly comparable products)
- Store names displayed in product titles
- More accurate pricing information
- Clear indication of online-only vs physical store products
- Enhanced filtering based on user location radius

### Next Steps
- Test with various product types to ensure consistent matching
- Consider adding specialized handling for specific product categories
- Monitor API usage to avoid rate limiting issues
